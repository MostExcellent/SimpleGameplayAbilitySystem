# Gameplay Tags

- Gameplay tags are used extensively in SimpleGAS to control the activation of abilities, define attributes and more.  
- The reason they are used so often instead of just using strings is because they are more efficient and can be used to filter and query data in a more efficient way. 
- They also have a designer friendly UI in the editor that stops all kinds of spelling mistakes from happening because you define a tag once and then select it from a list instead of typing the tag name every time.

Better writers than me have explained this topic so I'd like to refer you to this [article by Tom Looman](https://www.tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-gameplaytags-data-driven-design) to get an idea of what they are and how they can be used if you want to learn more.
