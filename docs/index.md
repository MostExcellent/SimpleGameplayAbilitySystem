# Simple Gameplay Ability System (SimpleGAS)

[SimpleGAS](https://github.com/strayTrain/SimpleGameplayAbilitySystem) provides an alternative to Unreal Engine's built-in **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**, focusing on developer experience and flexibility.

## Why Use SimpleGAS?

The built-in **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)** is powerful but comes with a steep learning curve and requires a lot of boilerplate code to get started. SimpleGAS aims to streamline the process by allowing for purely blueprint based setup and operation (while still allowing for c++ if you need it!)

### The elevator pitch

- **Simplified API:** Less boilerplate, more gameplay.
- **Blueprint-Friendly:** Can be used without writing any c++
- **Modular Design:** Components, attributes, and abilities are cleanly separated and easy to extend.
- **Replicated & Multiplayer-Ready:** Designed with networking in mind but also useful for single player games.
- **Lightweight & Customizable:** Adaptable to various game genres and mechanics.
